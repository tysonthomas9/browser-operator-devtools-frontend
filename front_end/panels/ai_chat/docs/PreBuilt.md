## Custom Chromium Build for macOS M-Series

### Download
Please download the latest macOS build from the [releases page](https://github.com/tysonthomas9/browser-operator-devtools-frontend/releases).

**Warning:** This build includes experimental AI features. Using these features may involve sending data to external services for processing. For your privacy and security, please avoid entering sensitive personal or work information while using this build.

### Updates
**Note:** This build does not include the standard Chromium auto-update feature. If you plan to use it regularly, please check the releases page weekly for the latest version. We are working on adding an official auto-update capability in the future.

### Using AI Features
This build contains experimental AI agents. To enable and use these features, you will need an API key from OpenAI. If you do not have one or are unfamiliar with OpenAI API keys, you can learn more and obtain one from the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/). You will be prompted to enter this key within the browser's AI panel when you first try to use an AI feature.

Note 
* We plan to support additional operating systems such as linux and windows soon.
* Future plan to support a hosted version of the LLM Models with signups soon.
